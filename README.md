# tableau_joining_blending_relationships_and_dual_axis_charts
Various vizzes showcasing the use of blends, joins and dual-axis charts:
  - airline_comparison contains a bar chart formed from blending data from two worksheets from Excel, which compares the airlines revenue over 2015 and 2016
  - amazing_mart contains a dual-axis chart, where we have sales in bar form overlaying an area chart showing targets. Another bar chart is nested underneath which shows the difference between actual sales and the target for that month
